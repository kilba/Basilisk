# Basilisk
## Introduction
### Welcome to Basilisk
Basilisk aims to be an engine written only in OpenGL without the help of any external libraries. This means that components such as 3D model loading/parsing/rendering, True Type Font loading/parsing/rendering, etc... will be written from scratch.

### TODO
There are still a lot of things to do until the engine is ready for anybody except for me to use, I also have a tendency to write unsafe code at times. The engine will be ready when it's ready :)

This is a broad overview of significant milestones:
- [x] Model Parsing & Rendering
- [x] Shaders (Compute, Geometry, UBO)
- [x] Framebuffers (Color, Depth, Render)
- [x] Textures (2D, Cubemaps)
- [ ] TrueType Font Parsing & Rendering
### TODO (Backburner)
- [ ] Inverse Kinematics
- [ ] Removing CGLTF
- [ ] mp4 Parser
- [ ] Custom Shader Language
