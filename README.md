# Basilisk
## Introduction
### Welcome to Basilisk
Basilisk aims to be an engine written only in OpenGL without the help of any external libraries. This means that components such as 3D model loading/parsing/rendering, True Type Font loading/parsing/rendering, etc... will be written from scratch.

More information can be found on the website, including documentation. This README will be used for instructions on compiling yourself in the future.
